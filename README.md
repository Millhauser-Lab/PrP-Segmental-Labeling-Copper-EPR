Pavlovici-etal-2025.xlsx contains FPLC, HPLC and mass spectrometry data for Figure 2, circular dichroism data in Figure 3, the continuous wave EPR spectra in Figures 3 and S2, and both time-domain and frequency transformed ESEEM data for Figures 4 and 5. Pulse sequences are described in the manuscript.

The separate HYSCORE .DSC and .DTA files are raw data. These files are analyzed using Hyscorean, with parameters described in the manuscript. https://github.com/JeschkeLab/Hyscorean

The results from the AlphaFold 3 simulations are in the zip file titled “fold_in_trans_prp_with_1cu.” Figure 6 was generated from fold_in_trans_prp_with_1cu_model_3.cif

PrP_His_distance_viewer_v4.cxs opens in ChimeraX. Protein coordinates are from PDBID: 1XYX. Distances between His139 and His176 Cβ atoms are annotated, as are the distances of closest approach between imidazole nitrogen atoms. Cα-Cβ rotomers may be adjusted using the Adjust Torsions knobs.
